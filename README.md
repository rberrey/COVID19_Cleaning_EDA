# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis Project

This project involves a comprehensive approach to data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
The Jupyter Notebook file includes various stages of data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis techniques 
applied to a COVID-19 dataset. This dataset includes real-world data obtained from HealthData.gov from May 2023 with COVID-19 metrics
at the county level in the United States. 

I decided to carry out EDA on counties in North Carolina since that is where I live!

Key Highlights:
- Data Cleaning: Steps include handling missing values, data type conversion, and more.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Involves data visualization, summary statistics, and other EDA techniques.
